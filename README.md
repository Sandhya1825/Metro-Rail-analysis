# Metro-Rail-analysis

🚅🚉 Metros are amongst the most critical, complex and valuable infrastructures for cities to perform successfully in the global competition to attract people, talent and business. With their large trains and short headways, metros offer more than 👩🏼‍🤝‍👩🏼👩🏽‍🤝‍👩🏻60,000 passengers per hour per direction and are ideally suited for the most heavily used transport corridors.

Metros are:

A stress-saver: Legible and easy to understand routes, high frequency, high reliability and travel time predictability offer passengers quality time to themselves.

A life-style marker: Metros provide a real alternative to unsustainable modes. For a similar level of service, urban rail attracts up to 20% additional passengers in comparison to other modes.

A strong enabler of economic development: Good and reliable metro services support efficient economies.

A space (re)creator: Space is a precious commodity in dense metropolitan areas. With very limited space requirements, metros are the most space-efficient transport system.
